# MATH-540-Final-Project
In this project, the error bound for the decision tree classifier is being verified empirically and tested on real world data. This repository will be linked in the final project report, which was written as a part of the MATH 540 Statistical Learning course. 
The decision tree classifier creates a binary tree to predict the labels of a dataset with several features. The error bound and the required data distribution are described in "Understanding machine learning: From theory to algorithms" Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David (2014).
The colab notebook includes a source code for the error analysis. Every cell contains a short information on what is being computed or plotted. The beginning two cells must be run first, as they call for necessary libraries and define the error bound function. The next two cells compute the experimental error and the error bound with respect to sample size and plot them on the same graph to compare. These two cells muct be run in sequence, since the second cell uses the information from the first one to plot the graphs. The other two cells do the same, but with the tree width.
In the real world data part, the cell where the breast cancer data is being loaded must be run first. The four cells after that do the same things as the four cells before, so the compilation sequence remains the same.
